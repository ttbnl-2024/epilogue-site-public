          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>SONG A is by SINGER A, who is from a COUNTRY that is an answer in Puzzle #7. SONGS B and C are sung by SINGER B. SONG A, the first word of SONG B, and the third word of SONG C all have word values equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The second word of SONG B is an answer in Puzzle #15. Replace two consecutive letters in SINGER A with MOVIE A and it would become the first word of SONG B. The real first name of SINGER A, the first name of CHARACTER A and the SPORTING VENUE (which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD) all begin with WORD A. CHARACTERS A &amp; B were from an answer in Puzzle #3. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ????????? ??????? ?????????. The first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY rearranges to WORK UNITS A &amp; B. WORK UNIT A is a category elsewhere in this puzzle series. The last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY, the plural of a word in the text of the puzzles both directly prior and directly after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series, has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The first word of FOOD BRAND A spans consecutively across the first two words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A would become one of the words of one of the CHARACTERS with its middle letter changed. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B is BAND A, of which SINGER C was a member. Add an “E” after the first letter in the real last name of SINGER A and her last name would begin with the first name of SINGER C. The COMEDIAN/(TARGET WORD)’s last name is an antonym for ACTOR A’s last name. Caesar-shift -1 the second letter of the last word of SONG B and it would rearrange to the first name of the COMEDIAN/(TARGET WORD). HISTORICAL EVENT occurred ten days before the birth of SINGER A; its third word is the first word of CHARACTER B. The first word of FOOD BRAND B is a homophone of MOVIE B. Combined, the first word + first five letters of the second word of FOOD BRAND B are a homophone of the full name of SPORTS PLAYER A. MOVIE A and MOVIE B are by the same PRODUCTION COMPANY, which has the same word value as each of the first two words of HISTORICAL EVENT. The first word (ANTONYM A) of SONG D by SINGER C is the antonym of SINGER C’s last name (ANTONYM B). Remove the space in SONG D to create the last name of ACTOR A. ACTOR A was in MOVIE D, the second word of which is MOVIE A. MOVIE D is a synonym for WORD B, an anagram of an answer from Puzzle #2. SONG E (the name of ACTOR B, who was involved in a (first word of CHARACTER B)) was sung by BAND B. ACTOR B played CHARACTERS C and D, whose last names are anagrams of each other. Five-letter (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C is a plural EDIBLE that begins the second word of FOOD BRAND A. The first word of FOOD BRAND A is found sequentially across the fourth and fifth words of a SONG from a puzzle four positions away from this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. All three answers to the UNKNOWN CATEGORY begin with the same letter. FOOD BRAND C’s first word begins with the last name of SPORTS PLAYER B, whose team notably won a championship game playing in SPORTING VENUE. BAND C’s first word is BAND B and its last two words are an otherwise-unassociated GENRE (which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD). The middle two words of FOOD BRAND C are associated with answers in the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. CHARACTER E has the same first name as the one SPORTS PLAYER B goes by and its last name is a middle name from Puzzle #1. ACTOR C played CHARACTER A and was also in MOVIE C, whose first word is the last word of an answer in this puzzle. NUMBER A is associated with someone known as Mr. (singular of the second word of UNKNOWN CATEGORY) and whose first name is a last name from Puzzle #11. NUMBER B is the only applicable homophone of the beginning of the first word of an answer in this puzzle.</p>
