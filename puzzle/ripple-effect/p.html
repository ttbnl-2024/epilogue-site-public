          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          <strong>Erratum</strong> on <time datetime="2025-03-10T04:04:58+00:00" data-format="F j, Y \a\t g:i A T">March 10, 2025 at 12:04 AM EDT</time>:
          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".
        </div>
      
    
      
    

    
    
      <p>The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ????? ??????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ???????? ??????. The word values of its initial letters sum to the word value of the TARGET WORD. The (fifth + sixth words) of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY are also an example of its (eighth + ninth words). The fifth word is LANGUAGE, spoken in the country directly west of COUNTRY A. Twelve-letter (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A contains a seven-letter string that rearranges to the ARTICLE OF CLOTHING, which begins with a MUSICAL found elsewhere in this puzzle series and ends with the last three letters of an answer in Puzzle #14. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A contains sequentially PAST-TENSE VERB A, which is a synonym of the EXPRESSIONS from Puzzle #17. Twelve-letter (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B ends in an anagram of a full name found earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Its other letters rearrange to three-letter WORD A, which begins the first word of a music genre featured later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Two-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C is SYNONYM A. SYNONYM B, the synonym of SYNONYM A, is a category from Puzzle #6. Ten-letter (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D is an antonym of the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C and ends in a category from Puzzles #7 and #9. Add a “B” to the fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and its fifth and sixth words would rearrange to COUNTRY A plus an answer from Puzzle #15. An anagram of CAPITAL CITY A, the capital of COUNTRY A, spans consecutively across the eighth and ninth words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. Add a letter between the second and third words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and they would span consecutively COUNTRY B. Remove the second letter of the fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and its third through fifth words will span consecutively CAPITAL CITY B. Change the second-to-last letter of the fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY to an “E” and its fifth through eighth words would span consecutively an anagram of PAST-TENSE VERB B. The gerund form of both PAST-TENSE VERBS is an example of, at best, (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B. At worst, the gerund form of PAST TENSE VERB B is SYNONYM C (a word that has a value equal to that of the TARGET WORD). Remove two consonants from SYNONYM D, a synonym of SYNONYM C, and it would rearrange to the TARGET WORD. The AUTHOR is associated with PAST-TENSE VERB B (though not its coiner); add an “A” in front of her first name and it would contain sequentially the reverse of CAPITAL CITY C, the capital of COUNTRY B. AUTHOR’s last name rearranges to PART OF THE (WORD B); both it and WORD B have a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. BOXER A’s last name rearranges to PART OF THE (WORD B). The FAMOUS ROBBER is known primarily by his nickname &amp; last name; the second word of his nickname is a synonym of the first word of BOXER A, and his last name is the first name of BOXER B. BOXERS A and B fought each other twice, with the same notable outcome (no, go ahead, note it, you’ll thank us later). SYNONYM F has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD; it and its synonym (SYNONYM E) are good qualities for most boxers to have. The first name of the ACTRESS is CAPITAL CITY B; she appeared in two-word MOVIE A. The first word of MOVIE A is MOVIE B, which was produced by the PRODUCTION COMPANY from Puzzle #5. The second word of MOVIE A is an answer from later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Exchange that word with another from the same category in that same puzzle to make the TV SHOW. If you place a letter in the space between the two words in MOVIE A, it would contain sequentially SYNONYM F. The UNIVERSITY’s byname anagrams to SYNONYM E; the first word of the two-word byname is a word of a SONG answered later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. NUMBER A is the number directly associated with the earliest of a group of answers from a puzzle two positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. NUMBER B is the quantity of words in the answer in the properly-ordered puzzle series that has the most words (it’s in a later puzzle in this series).</p>
