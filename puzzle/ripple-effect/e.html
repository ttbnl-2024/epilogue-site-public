          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

      <p>BASEBALL PLAYERS A and B have last names that are ANIMALS A and B, respectively. Switch the second and last vowels in ACTOR’s name and it would span consecutively ANIMAL A. BASEBALL PLAYER C’s last name ends INGREDIENT A. All three BASEBALL PLAYERS play(ed) for the same BASEBALL TEAM (alliterative, though not necessarily at the time each BASEBALL PLAYER was on it). The first word of the NICKNAME (given to BASEBALL PLAYER A) is the second word of one of the NICKNAMES in Puzzle #6 and its second word is associated with ANIMALS A and B. The first two words of MUSICAL A are an answer to a puzzle three positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the last letter of the first name of CHARACTER A from MUSICAL A and it would become the first name of CHARACTER B from MUSICAL B. The reverse of MUSICAL B is consecutively within a one-word answer later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Add a letter to the first name of CHARACTER B to make MUSICAL C. ACTOR, whose name rearranges to INGREDIENT A, played CHARACTER C in MUSICAL A. Change the tenth letter of CHARACTER C’s last name so that it ends in the first word of RESTAURANT CHAIN. Remove the second to last letter of the first word of the RESTAURANT CHAIN and the RESTAURANT CHAIN would span consecutively an anagram of the first word of an answer from a puzzle two positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The seven-letter FOOD BRAND rearranges to the beginning of the second word of CHARACTER C. Two-word INGREDIENT B is the source of INGREDIENT A. The second word of MOVIE is a homophone for the first word of INGREDIENT B, and its first word is ANIMAL C. The first name of CHARACTER D, from MOVIE, is MUSICAL C and its last name is the first word of a SONG from the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The last word of NOVEL is INGREDIENT C and its second word is associated with one of the BASEBALL PLAYERS. Change one letter in the NOVELIST’s last name and it would end in one of the BODY PARTS from Puzzle #11. BAND A is the homophone of INGREDIENT D and ends one of the answers in this puzzle. Change the second to last letter of SONG A by BAND A to another vowel and SONG A would contain two-word BAND B sequentially. The first word of BAND B is the same as the first word of SONG A. The second word of SONG A is DEVICE A, which can act as DEVICE B (word value is equal to that of the TARGET WORD), both of which are related to an answer from Puzzle #15. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ??????? ???? ?????. (Plural of the first two words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY) are something that a devotee WORD (word value equals that of the TARGET WORD). Remove the last letter of WORD to make SYNONYM A, which begins the last word of one of the categories in the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series). Change the second letter of the second word of BASEBALL TEAM and it would span consecutively an anagram of the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. The third word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD and begins with SYNONYM B. Replace the middle letter from (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B with a space to make the first and last words, respectively, of SONG B. SONG C, which is directly prior to SONG B in MUSICAL B, is sung by CHARACTER B, played by ACTRESS. The third word of SONG C is a heteronym of the ANCIENT CITY; change its last letter to something else to make a BAND featured in a puzzle later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. ACTRESS’ first name is the first word of an answer for a puzzle five positions away from this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the second letter of ACTRESS’ last name and it will become a phrase describing the phrase made when combining two answers from another puzzle’s UNKNOWN CATEGORY into a single two-word phrase. NUMBER A directly precedes the only apt answer in this puzzle. NUMBER B is the lowest number found sequentially in a first name featured in a puzzle ten positions away from this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series.</p>
