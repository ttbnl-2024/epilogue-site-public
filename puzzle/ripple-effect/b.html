          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>ACTRESS played CHARACTER A, whose first name (SYNONYM A) is an answer from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series and whose last name (OCCUPATION) is the singular of the second word of a TV SHOW from Puzzle #15. The anagram of OCCUPATION is spanned consecutively across (OCCUPATION) A’s name. Change the first letter of ACTRESS’ last name and its anagram, WORD A, would end an answer’s last name from Puzzle #3. Add an “A” somewhere in the last name of FORMER LEADER and it would end with SYNONYM A. His last name contains consecutively a three-letter answer found elsewhere in this puzzle series. His first name contains WORD B consecutively, a synonym of a category used throughout these puzzles. Exchange the fourth and eighth letters of his last name and it would contain ISLAND sequentially. LIVING THING is a word that can come after both ISLAND and SYNONYM A. (OCCUPATION) B’s first name is a heteronym for SYNONYM B, a synonym of SYNONYM A. BASKETBALL PLAYER, who played for a team referenced elsewhere in this puzzle series, has SYNONYM A beginning his first name. His last name is EDIBLE A, which has EDIBLE B as an anagram. Caesar-shift -1 the last letter of the first word of two-word FAMOUS (EDIBLE A) and it would begin the second word of PRODUCT A. The first word of PRODUCT A is synonymous with a MOVIE from a puzzle two positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. PRODUCTS A &amp; B were made by COMPANY A - as was one other we’re sure you’re expecting to see, but this was long enough already, so just write down the dance-associated one and enjoy the freebie. (OCCUPATION) B starred in TV SHOW A. BAND A (SYNONYM C) sang SONG A, which is heavily associated with both TV SHOW A and the aforementioned TV SHOW from Puzzle #15. Add a letter to SYNONYM D, the synonym of SYNONYM C, and it will rearrange to the birth last name of (OCCUPATION) B. CHARACTER B, which was played by (OCCUPATION) B in MUSICAL, contains sequentially a six-letter answer from Puzzle #8. The word values of the first two words of MUSICAL sum to equal the total word value of the last two words of MUSICAL. PRODUCT B is the combination of two one-word answers from Puzzle #15. The beginning of COMPANY A is BAND B, which sang SONG B. The last two words of SONG B are the first two words of an OCCUPATION from Puzzle #13. Change the first letter of the second-to-last word of SONG B and SONG B’s last two words would form ADJECTIVE, which has been used to describe the FAMOUS (EDIBLE A). The first and last words of TV SHOW B are PRODUCT A. Remove the fourth letter of the last name of CHARACTER C from TV SHOW B and it would begin with an anagram of WORD B. Six-letter EDIBLE C and seven-letter (slang) DRINK are both found sequentially in CHARACTER C’s last name. The last name of (TARGET WORD), a member of BAND C, ends in the same six letters as CHARACTER C’s last name. Change the second letter of his last name to an “A” and it would contain sequentially the first name of CHARACTER C. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ?????-???? ?????? ???????????. The last word of SONG C by BAND C spans consecutively across the first two words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The inside letters of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A are one of the words of NICKNAME A in Puzzle #6. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A has the same length, first letter, and punctuation placement as COMPANY A. Change the first letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B to a “D” and it would rearrange to COMPANY B. Add a letter to the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it would rearrange to (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. An anagram of the nine-letter first name of the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE is spanned consecutively across the third and fourth words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY; change the first letter of his last name and it would become a word seen in several answers throughout this puzzle series. An anagram of the two-word CAR MODEL is spanned consecutively across the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. Change the first letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C to create MATERIAL. Before issuing their PRODUCT C, COMPANY B would perform an ACTIVITY, the word value of which is the same as that of the TARGET WORD, and the first word of which, when preceding the last four letters of COMPANY B names PRODUCT C. The last word of PRODUCT C is the middle word of an UNKNOWN CATEGORY earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Caesar-shift +1 the fifth letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B and it would begin with a synonym of one of the words used throughout the puzzle text in this puzzle series (including this one). The species of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY B) is commonly associated with a (WORD A from Puzzle #15) (HOMOPHONE A from Puzzle #15). NUMBER A is the chapter number that introduced the Biblical character from a puzzle two positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Remove the second letter from one of the BANDS in this category and the remainder would become phonetically a homophone of NUMBER B.</p>
