          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>SYNONYM A is the second word of an UNKNOWN CATEGORY elsewhere in this puzzle series. SYNONYM B is a synonym of SYNONYM A and begins the second word of the BASKETBALL TEAM A. The last word of the three-word FORMER NAME of the BASKETBALL TEAM A rearranges to the end of COMPOSER A. COMPOSER B’s last name is an anagram of the first word of the BASKETBALL TEAM A. COUNTRY A, which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD, is the location of CITY A, where COMPOSER B died. EDIBLE A’s first word is CITY A, which is also the name of a song associated with a (TARGET WORD) from a puzzle later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The BASKETBALL TEAM A rearranges into EDIBLE B plus the last names of the POET and ACTRESS. POET’s first name begins with the first word of two-word EDIBLE H and ends with EDIBLE C, and his last name is the same as a last name from Puzzle #15. EDIBLE D is alliterative. The GAME is comprised of the first word of EDIBLE D followed by EDIBLE E. The second word of EDIBLE F is an anagram of the second word of MOVIE A and its first word is an anagram of the beginning of the last name of COMPOSER A. The first and last words of MOVIE A are, together, an answer to a puzzle two positions away from this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the third letter of EDIBLE G and it would end in an anagram of the last name of FORMER LEADER A. The last word of the POEM, by POET, is the source common to all of the EDIBLES in this puzzle, as well as an EDIBLE from Puzzle #1. The second word of the POEM is MOVIE B, part of a series featuring ACTOR portraying CHARACTER. Both CHARACTER and ACTOR have the same word value. The last name of the DIRECTOR of MOVIE C, which starred ACTRESS, is the second word of EDIBLE D. MOVIE C’s words are, in order, the middle words of a MOVIE EXCLAMATION from MOVIE A. Change the last letter of the first name of three-word FORMER LEADER B and it will rearrange to LETTER A. LETTER B, if rearranged, spans consecutively across the first two names of FORMER LEADER B. LETTERS A &amp; B are from the same country as the COMPOSER from Puzzle #11. FORMER LEADER B was born in CITY B, which would become the second word of one of the EDIBLES if its last letter is changed. CITY C is the birthplace of FORMER LEADER A, found sequentially across COUNTRY B where it is located. COUNTRY B is the second word of the THEME SONG of BASKETBALL TEAM A. Add a letter in the space between the two words of one of the EDIBLES and it would span consecutively CITY D. BASKETBALL PLAYER A from BASKETBALL TEAM A is known by a nickname that is the first word of THEME SONG; the first three letters of his last name are a type of ___ (last word of THEME SONG). Change the first letter of the first word of the THEME SONG to an “N” and that word would rearrange to a contraction of the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. Caesar shift -2 a letter in GAME and it would contain consecutively the reverse of the second word of BASKETBALL TEAM B. That word is the nickname of BASKETBALL PLAYER B, who is on the payroll of BASKETBALL TEAM A, though never officially played for them. BASKETBALL PLAYER C, from BASKETBALL TEAM A, has a nickname that describes EDIBLE G. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ??????????? ?????????, and anagrams to OCCUPATIONS A &amp; B plus the MATERIAL from Puzzle #9. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is a quote from a movie that also featured an answer integral to the gimmick of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY in Puzzle #14. The first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY contains consecutively the first word of one of the MOVIES in this puzzle. Change the pair of double letters in the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY with a different pair of double letters and it would end in a SYNONYM in the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is a name, and its last word is something you might call a person of OCCUPATION B. WORD may be placed after the second word of SONG A, the first word of BASKETBALL TEAM A, and the nickname of BASKETBALL PLAYER C to make well-known phrases. SONG A is by BAND, and its first word is the first word of FORMER NAME. SONG B by BAND, from the same album, begins with the ANIMAL. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B is a three-word literary franchise, and its second word contains WRITER/GAME SHOW HOST sequentially. Four-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C’s first word is seven-letter SYNONYM C, a preposition. SYNONYM D, the synonym of SYNONYM C, has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The last word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C is the second word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and the second word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C begins the fourth word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. The SPORTS TEAM’s second word is the third word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B and its first word is a BAND featured in a puzzle later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. NUMBER A is the smallest number found sequentially (not reverse) across the first two words of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. NUMBER B is the only applicable song title by the BAND from Puzzle #17 (whose first word is NUMBER A from Puzzle #16 and whose second word is a category from a puzzle two positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series), from their album which would also fit this category.</p>
