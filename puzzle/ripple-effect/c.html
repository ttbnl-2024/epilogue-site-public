          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>Add a “C” to the ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE (don’t @ us, it means the same thing) and it would rearrange to OCCUPATION A, the first word of which is a synonym for an answer from Puzzle #9. Add an “N” to the ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE and it would rearrange to UNIT OF MEASURE and a COUNTRY answered earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The first word of the ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE is something used with the first word of an IDIOM from Puzzle #6. The second word of the ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE can come after one of the answers from Puzzle #5. (TARGET WORD)s A-C are all from three-word BAND A (which hails from the suburb of an answer earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series). Remarkably, (TARGET WORD)s A-C each have a last name with a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. (TARGET WORD) D, also from BAND A, just misses out on that cool coincidence, but his OCCUPATION B’s word value equals that of the TARGET WORD, so let’s throw him in as (TARGET WORD) D. While we’re on the subject, the word value of the TARGET WORD has a less cool association with the (TARGET WORD) from a puzzle seven positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series - one that will lead you to the first step of solving this puzzle series. Three-word SONG A by BAND A has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Add an “O” to the second word of RAPPER A (a stage name) and it would become one of the SYNONYMS from Puzzle #4. SONG B by RAPPER A (who was born in the same city referenced above) is a homophone for (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. SONG C sung by RAPPERS A &amp; B (or, if your musical tastes differ, sung by an answer from Puzzle #13), contains sequentially an answer from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The first two words of RAPPER B (a stage name) have a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ???? ??? ????? ???????. The second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY ends the last name of (TARGET WORD) C. The singular of the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is found sequentially across one of the MOVIES from Puzzle #14. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B was played by ACTOR. Change the sixth letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B to an “R” and it would begin with an anagram of COUNTRY (some of you might quibble it more appropriate to additionally add the first word of SONG A while you’re at it, but either way, (SONG A)). Change the last letter of ACTOR’s last name and it would become an answer from an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C is the last word of MUSICAL, and has an additional association with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A (they are each a WORD A, which has the same word value as the TARGET WORD). The first word of the MUSICAL is the second word of the ALBUM A by BAND A. ALBUM A is composed of MOVIE A and MOVIE B, respectively (one of which was also an answer earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series). Remove a letter from the MUSICAL and it becomes ALBUM B, by a BAND featured earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D’s name is a heterogram, both words containing five letters each. (TARGET WORD) A spans consecutively a six-letter WORD B that (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D may be associated with. Change the second letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D’s first name and it would begin with the first name of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) E from one-word MOVIE C. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) E’s last name is SYNONYM A, which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. A homophone of SYNONYM A is the nickname of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) F, who is from a movie by a PRODUCTION COMPANY featured earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The names of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D-F have the same initials. Change the second letter of SYNONYM A and it would become a first name of an answer in Puzzle #16. SYNONYM B is a synonym of SYNONYM A and has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Seven-letter BAND B sang SONG D, a title of a movie featuring a CHARACTER from earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The second word of SONG D is an answer from earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The two-word SLANG PHRASE has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD; its first word is BAND B and its second word is RAPPER A’s first name. Change the first letter of a last name from Puzzle #15 and it would begin with NUMBER A. NUMBER B is the quantity of letters in the longest first name among any of the proper names that are answers in the puzzle series.</p>
