          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>Insert an “I” after the third letter of EDIBLE and it would contain consecutively a category from Puzzle #17. The MUSICAL is the beginning of that Puzzle #17 category. Change the second letter of MUSICAL and it would be the first word of a PHRASE from Puzzle #6. (TARGET WORD)s A &amp; B are associated with MUSICAL. Change a letter in (TARGET WORD) A and he would rearrange to the first name of ACTRESS A + the COUNTRY. (TARGET WORD)s A &amp; B share OCCUPATION A. Remove the third letter of OCCUPATION A and it would begin with an anagram of the ISLAND, which can be described as one of the words in the UNKNOWN CATEGORY from Puzzle #12. Add a letter to the last name of (TARGET WORD) B and it would contain the first word of a category from Puzzle #6. Change one letter in the last name of ACTRESS A and it would rearrange to MOVIE A in which she starred. SYNONYMS A-C are synonyms of each other. SYNONYM A is a game found consecutively in ACTRESS A’s first name and is seen consecutively in multiple puzzles in this series. SYNONYM B contains consecutively the reverse of SYNONYM A and is the synonym of one of the categories in this puzzle. Hyphenated PHRASE A’s second word ends in SYNONYM C, and PHRASE A is a synonym of an answer from Puzzle #17. Change the second letter of DANCE and it will become MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A. The first two words of SONG A from MUSICAL collectively begin one of the words in a category in this puzzle. SONG A’s third word is an anagram of either MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A or B. The second word of PHRASE B can describe any of MYTHOLOGICAL BEINGS A-C. ACTRESS B self-described herself as PHRASE B. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ???????? ?? ???? ????? ????????????? ?? ????? ???? ?????. Its first word is the plural of the second word of a category earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The second and sixth words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY are the same. The fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY rearranges to OCCUPATION B (plural) + the third word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. OCCUPATION B describes ACTRESSES B-D. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is associated with FAMOUS PERSON A and begins with a MOVIE answered earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series and ends with the singular of a homophone for the last word of an UNKNOWN CATEGORY from another puzzle. Caesar-shift +1 the last letter of FAMOUS PERSON A’s first name and it would end in the third word of SONG A. The last name of FAMOUS PERSON B, associated with one-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B, is a homophone of the plural of the second word of PHRASE C. Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C. The last word of PHRASE C is edible and is encountered numerous times throughout this puzzle series. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B contains MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A consecutively. HOMOPHONE A can follow SYNONYM B, EDIBLE, or WORD A to make common phrases. If a person is easily HOMOPHONE B, they are likely to (SYNONYM A) (PHRASE A). Change the last letter of the second word of two-word PHRASE D to make the last word of a MUSICAL from the puzzle six positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. PHRASE D has the same word value as ACTRESS C. The last word of the three-word SPORTS TERM is SYNONYM C. The first two words of SPORTS TERM are (PHRASE D) A and (PHRASE D) B, respectively, which refer to the word values of the first and last names of ACTRESS C. The first name of ACTRESS D is MYTHOLOGICAL BEING B; she appeared in MOVIES A &amp; B. Two-word MOVIE B is a synonym for an answer from Puzzle #4. The first word of MOVIE C, which featured an ACTOR answered earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series, is one of the answers in this puzzle. Change the fourth letter of the first word of an answer in this puzzle and it would be OCCUPATION C, which is directly associated with OCCUPATION D, the homophone of the singular of the second word of MOVIE C. ACTRESS D played CHARACTER in MOVIE B; CHARACTER begins one of the answers to one of the UNKNOWN CATEGORIES elsewhere in this puzzle series. Remove three consecutive letters from TV SHOW A, a name one would associate with the fourth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY, to make (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B. TV SHOW B, a miniseries, refers to FAMOUS PERSON B. SYNONYM D, the second word of TV SHOW B, is the synonym of SYNONYM E, the singular of BAND A. Switch the fourth and fifth letters of the second word of BAND B and BAND B would contain (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B sequentially. MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A spans consecutively across BAND B. BANDS A &amp; B belong to the same music genre - not the same one as in the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series, but just as meaningful for the next step of solving this puzzle series). The first word of SONG B by BAND A is MYTHOLOGICAL BEING C. Remove the last letter of a BAND from Puzzle #13 and its last two words would end SONG B. POLITICIAN A’s last name ends with the beginning of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A; change a letter in the second word of BAND B and that word would rearrange to POLITICIAN A’s office when that event occurred (OCCUPATION E). The first part of POLITICIAN A’s last name, the second part of his last name, and a second-letter change of his first name would be good answers to different categories in Puzzle #10. Add a letter to the seventh word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it will rearrange to the last name of POLITICIAN B, who was also a(n) OCCUPATION E at one time. POLITICIAN B’s first name is found sequentially in one of the other OCCUPATIONS. The last two words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY are a phrase seen many times throughout this puzzle series. CARTOON CHARACTER A, which has the same initials as ACTRESS C and MOVIE B, and CARTOON CHARACTER B (which begins with an answer from earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series) are both related to a CARTOON CHARACTER answered later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Move the last letter of the second word of HEALTH CONDITION to the space between its two words and the HEALTH CONDITION would both span consecutively the last name of FAMOUS PERSON B and begin with the last part of CARTOON CHARACTER B (WORD B). The first word of HEALTH CONDITION is located in the home country of SINGER A from Puzzle #5. MOVIE D stars ACTOR, who shares the same first name as FAMOUS PERSON A. MOVIE D would be a reasonable category name for FAMOUS PERSON A, one of the answers to the UNKNOWN CATEGORY from Puzzle #1, and a FAMOUS PERSON featured in the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. NUMBER A is the non-fractional part of the lowest fractional number that is, or is in, an answer in this puzzle series. If you consider each word in the titles of the MOVIES in this puzzle individually and record their lengths, NUMBER B is the largest non-unique length.</p>
