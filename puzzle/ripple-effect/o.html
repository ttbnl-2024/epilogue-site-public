          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>The TOPONYM (a local capital) has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD; it is a (first word of an answer from Puzzle #17) WORD A. Add an “F” and it would become the EDIBLE (a type of second word of the same answer from Puzzle #17 referenced earlier). WORD A both begins the last name of the ACTOR/COMEDIAN and spans consecutively an answer from a puzzle later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The MUSICAL starred ACTOR/COMEDIAN playing FAMOUS PERSON A in its original LOCATION (same word value as the TARGET WORD) run. FAMOUS PERSON B was also featured in the MUSICAL. Change the last letter of FAMOUS PERSON B and his last name will contain sequentially the INSTRUMENT associated with (TARGET WORD)s A and B. The (TARGET WORD) A’s last name begins with the first word of the alliterative ARTICLE OF CLOTHING (which was worn by FAMOUS PERSON A in MUSICAL), and his first name is a foreign translation of the first name of FAMOUS PERSON B. FAMOUS PERSON A is associated with FAMOUS PERSON C (okay, you got us, if you’re working out the next step of this puzzle series, you should technically have answered this person in the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series before doing so here). Add a letter to the end of DRUG BRAND NAME A to make MONTH A. MONTH B is the only one with a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD, but the sum of the word values of MONTH C [(TARGET WORD) B’s last name] &amp; D does as well. The SINGER, whose last name would be fitting for a category in Puzzle #10, co-founded a band with (TARGET WORD) B. Caesar-shift -1 the last letter of a category from Puzzle #2 and it would be the second word of DRUG BRAND NAME B. Both DRUG BRAND NAMES are intended to be used for the same medical purpose. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????? ? ????????? ????????. The word values of its initial letters sum to that of the TARGET WORD. The first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is the JOEY WORD. The KANGAROO WORD ends in the JOEY WORD. The word values of the sixth and eighth words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY each equal that of the TARGET WORD. The last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY begins with the second word of a nickname answered earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is edible; remove its last letter and it would rearrange to the first word of a TV SHOW from a puzzle three positions away from this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the fifth letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and it would contain consecutively the reverse of a COUNTRY that is an answer later in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Add the first and last letters of the MONTH in this puzzle that contains sequentially the reverse of the last name of the SINGER from Puzzle #10 to the sixth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it would rearrange to the first name of ANIMATED CHARACTER. Add a letter to the end of the sixth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY to make the STATIONERY ITEM. The ANIMATED CHARACTER is from three-word MOVIE A, the first two words of which have a collective word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Add a letter to one of the FAMOUS PERSONS and it would rearrange to the HYPOTHETICAL EXCLAMATION, which is something the two-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B might shout if it were collectively trying to garner attention. An anagram of the one-word SONG, which is by a BAND that is an answer earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series, is spanned consecutively across (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B. SONG is something you might shout if confronted by MUSICAL. BAND wrote and sang one-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C, which ends in the second word of one of the answers to Puzzle #1. The members of BAND all have nicknames, of which only one (WORD C) directly fits the category (first word of BAND). Caesar-shift -1 the first letter of WORD C to make an answer earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The plural of the first word of BAND is often paired with the plural of WORD B. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A would fit under the category WORD B. (WORD B) A has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD and contains five-letter TITLE sequentially (the TITLE is the next in rank after a TITLE answered in an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series). Remove the last letter from the last name of an ACTRESS in the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series to make (WORD B) B. Change the fourth letter of (WORD B) C and it would become CITY, which is in the same country as the TOPONYM. The first word of MOVIE B, which starred ACTRESS A from Puzzle #6, is MONTH C and its last word is MONTH E. Numerically, NUMBER A is one fewer than the foreign number beginning the EDIBLE. NUMBER B is the number associated with the first word of the leader of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D from Puzzle #18, when interpreted in the same context as all three words are intended in a three-word MOVIE earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series.</p>
