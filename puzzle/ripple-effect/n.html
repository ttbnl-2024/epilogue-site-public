          In Puzzle H, the sentence "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the first word of five-letter PHRASE C." should instead read "Change the second letter of one of the words in one of the categories in this puzzle and it will become the five-letter first word of PHRASE C." Additionally, a SONG referenced in this puzzle series is not real, despite Google / YouTube currently returning search results for it.

          In Puzzle A, the phrase "its second word begins one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier" should instead read "its second word begins with one of the words in the same other-puzzle UNKNOWN CATEGORY referenced earlier".

      <p>The SYNONYMS in this puzzle are not all synonyms of each other, grouped thusly: A-B, C-D, E-F-G, H-I, and then separately, I-J and F-K. DIRECTOR directed MOVIE A starring ACTOR A. Change the last letter of DIRECTOR’s first name to another vowel and it would become a CITY from Puzzle #4. Both ACTOR A’s full name and the plural of the six-letter WORD A spanning consecutively across DIRECTOR’s first and last name have a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. ACTOR B starred in MOVIE A; his last name is a homophone of an answer from Puzzle #7. The last name of CHARACTER A played by ACTOR A in MOVIE A is SYNONYM A, a word that may be spoken by a (second and third words of MOVIE A). MOVIE B (the JOEY WORD) starred ACTOR A and ACTRESS. MOVIE B would be SYNONYM E if its first letter were changed. SYNONYM B would begin ACTOR B’s last name if that name’s first letter were changed. Change one letter in ACTOR A’s first name and it can rearrange to become ACTRESS’ last name. Caesar shift -1 the fourth letter of ACTRESS’ first name and it would contain sequentially MOVIE B. MOVIE C is the KANGAROO WORD. SYNONYMS C &amp; D are synonyms of the KANGAROO WORD and JOEY WORD. SYNONYM C is an answer to the flavortext and is found sequentially across MOVIE A. SYNONYM D is the first word of another answer in this puzzle. SYNONYM E is ACTOR A’s last name. SYNONYM F is the last name of [(KANGAROO WORD) (WORD B)] A. [(KANGAROO WORD) (WORD B)] B’s last name begins with a last name from Puzzle #5 and ends with the second word of one of the answers in this puzzle. One commonly uses a SYNONYM G on a (last four letters of one of the MOVIES) that is part of a (beginning of SYNONYM F), and SYNONYM G can precede the sixth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ??????. Change the first letter of the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY to make ANIMAL A (the plural BODY PART) which, along with ANIMAL B (the fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY) may be kept in a SYNONYM F. ACTOR C appeared in MOVIE D, the first two words of which are collectively SYNONYM H and the last word of which is the plural of WORD B. OCCUPATION begins with ACTOR C’s last name. ACTOR C’s first name ends in a four-letter word that also ends the first name of an answer to Puzzle #17. PERSON was a(n) OCCUPATION; his first name is a SPORTS TERM used earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series and his last name is also an answer from a puzzle earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Add a letter to an answer in the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series to make SYNONYM I. SYNONYM J has the same word value as the TARGET WORD. Add a letter to SYNONYM J and rearrange to make WORD C, which describes the association between the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A from Puzzle #4 and a consecutive string in (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B from Puzzle #14. WORD C also serves as a puzzle category for the last word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A from Puzzle #4 and the second word of a BAND from Puzzle #3. The second word of the SLANG PHRASE is the last name of PERSON, and its first word begins the first name of the DIRECTOR. The POLITICIAN’s last name is the DIRECTOR’s first name. UNKNOWN CATEGORY’s initial letters add up to the word value of the TARGET WORD. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is an answer from Puzzle #1. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B begins with one of the answers from this puzzle and ends with the last word of a SONG from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the second letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C to a “T” and it would begin with the same five-letter word as [(KANGAROO WORD) (WORD B)] B’s last name. Add a letter between the two words of SLANG PHRASE to make TV SHOW A. The title character of TV SHOW B, which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD, is a resident of TV SHOW A. The TV SHOW HOST has the same first name as ACTRESS, starred in TV SHOW B, and if the fourth letter of her last name were Caesar-shifted +1, it would rearrange to a SYNONYM K. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D can follow the first word of two-word NOVEL A, which is something given by MOVIE A. The first word of SLANG PHRASE is MOVIE E, which featured ACTOR D whose last name is shared with one of the [(KANGAROO WORD) (WORD B)]s. The first word of NOVEL B is the plural of the first name of CHARACTER B, played by TV SHOW HOST in TV SHOW B. Change the first vowel in the first word of NOVEL B to an “I” and it would contain sequentially the six-letter second word of NOVEL C. The last word of NOVEL B ends the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The BODY PART (plural) in this puzzle are very near the BODY PART from a puzzle three positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Change the last letter of the first name of ACTRESS and it would rearrange to (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) E; it can also follow the first word of NOVEL A. The last word of NOVEL C can be a synonym of answers from Puzzle #1. NOVELS A-C are all from the same series. The first name of NOVELIST (who is not associated with the NOVELS) is a homophone of ACTOR A’s first name, and his last name is the plural of the beginning of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. NUMBER A is the quantity of letters in the full name among the answers in this puzzle that is alphabetically last. NUMBER B is the quantity of (WORD from Puzzle #2) letters in whichever movie from the puzzle three positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series contains the most of them.</p>
