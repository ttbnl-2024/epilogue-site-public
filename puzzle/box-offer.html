Usually, they contain the name of a celebrity, and the symbol at the center of the star represents the industry in which they rose to fame. However the names in these stars do not look so conventional, so maybe you should ask the question, what does every great film need? And the answer of course, is a great villain! Pandora is known for her close ties to all things evil. See if you can pair each of these &#x27;stars&#x27; with another of the puzzle artifacts that you have uncovered.</p></td>

Now rather than listing the name of this person (which we can assume to be one of her &quot;wicked&quot; (evil) friends, a clue phrase is provided.

For your convenience, these have already been identified for you. You can also guess that this means the number of charms provides a enumeration, specifically, the enumeration of the thing referenced in the sender line in the address on each box.</p></td>

Think about how you could potentially reuse some of the obscure artifacts in this puzzle given a new context, or more specifically, a new film!

You may be wondering why the Hollywood Walk of Fame stars were even used at all, because the actors (celebrity) names haven&#x27;t even been relevant to the puzzle.

We promise we tried to make it easier this time. As any celebrity will warn you, you should always read the fine print at the bottom of the document before signing any contracts. You already have a mass, and you are given an acceleration, so logically there is only one thing left to find... If you are still stuck, try using F=ma.</p></td>

    [Start transcript]<br/>
    Hey viewers, it’s ya girl, Pandora, filming a very special video for you all today on the famous Hollywood Boulevard in the wonderful city of Los Angeles, California!<br/>
    [Pandora is on screen, looking giddy. She has a pile of small boxes in front of her along with some Pandora jewellery gift bags.]<br/>
    I see some of my wicked cool friends have sent me a few gifts! Aww… how charming!<br/>
    [Smiling gleefully, she picks up a box from the pile, waves it in front of the camera, and puts it back down.]<br/>
    Yep, you guessed it, today, we will be doing another one of my unboxing videos.<br/>
    And, between you and me, I think some of these items might even be the real deal!<br/>
    [Pandora picks up a box and attempts to open it. She fails and looks puzzled.]<br/>
    Hmm... well that’s weird.<br/>
    I can’t seem to get this one open... or this one... or this one.<br/>
    [The screen cuts to black. A voiceover and the text on the screen say, "Five hours later...”.<br/>
    Pandora appears again looking completely soaked, water dripping everywhere.]<br/>
    Well viewers, you’ll never guess what was inside all these stupid boxes, or how I opened them... or what was making it so freaking difficult!<br/>
    [Screen fades out.]<br/>
    [End transcript]
