  <summary>Starting Hint</summary>

  <p class="spoiler">
    Apollo has taken a number of classical music (or rather Western art music) melodies and mixed them together into a larger work.
  </p>

  <p class="spoiler">
    The piece is a set of five minipuzzles (and a separate minimeta).
    The puzzles are sections A-E; you can ignore the sections marked M# for now.
    The actual puzzle content are the parts marked in black and blue.
    Start with parts marked in blue; each is a hint for how the entire segment functions.
    You can safely ignore parts in gray; those are largely accompaniment to other pieces in the work, and are mostly to make everything sound nice.
  </p>

  <p class="spoiler">If you get stuck, here's some further advice:</p>

  <details>
    <summary><span class="spoiler">More on getting started</span></summary>
    <p class="spoiler">
      You will need to identify the actual pieces.
      The composers' initials are given as a hint.
      <a href="https://musipedia.org">Musipedia</a> is a great way to identify melodies of any kind, particularly classical.
      The medley may change a melody's key, rhythm, or tempo to fit its section; the contour, however, will always be the same.
    </p>
  </details>

<p class="flavor">
  Apollo, patron of the establishment where you now find yourself, has been hammering away at the piano.
  It's a grand composition, but he believes the qualities of the original works dominate in every case.
