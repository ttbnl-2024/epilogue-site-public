      <h4>What is this? How do I solve these puzzles?</h4>
      <p>Each puzzle in this hunt comes with some information, and the goal is to extract an answer out of it. The puzzles can take many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it’s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you’re given. You can read a longer introduction to puzzlehunts <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you’re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as <a href="https://galacticpuzzlehunt.com/">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a href="https://teammatehunt.com/">Teammate Hunt</a>, <a href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>, <a href="https://huntinality.com/">Huntinality</a>, or <a href="https://reddothunt.sg">REDDOThunt</a>.</p>

          <h4>Who is running this hunt?</h4>
          <p>
            We are a subset of the running team of the <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/">2024 MIT Mystery Hunt</a>, The Team Formerly Known As The Team Formerly Known As The Team Formerly Known As The Team Formerly Known As The Team Formerly Known As The Team Formerly Known As The Team To Be Named Later.

          <h4>What do you mean by epilogue? Do I need to have done MITMH24?</h4>
          <p>
            This epilogue is a continuation of the <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/oracle">story of MITMH24</a>. However, it will not use any answers or puzzle content from MITMH24, and you can participate in and solve the epilogue without knowledge of anything from MITMH24.

          <h4>How long and difficult is this hunt?</h4>
          <p>
            There will be 1 round of 12 puzzles, and one meta; plus some standalone puzzles. These are Mystery Hunt style puzzles that range in difficulty from "Hera" to "Underworld" to "Overworld", with the majority being "Overworld" in difficulty.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="no-break">
          <h4>Wait, standalone puzzles?</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to the round, we are also releasing an extremely long, round length, puzzle originally written and fully successfully testsolved for the original hunt that was cut due to length concerns. We will also be releasing two puzzles that did not pass testsolving, but have fun creative artifacts that you may enjoy viewing or listening to. These standalone puzzles are not required to "complete" the epilogue, but the round-length puzzle will be shown separately on the leaderboard for bragging rights.

          <h4>What exactly happens when the hunt ends?</h4>
          <p>
            
            When the hunt ends on <strong><time datetime="2025-03-16T23:00:00-04:00" data-format="l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A T">Sunday, March 16, 2025 at 11:00 PM EDT</time></strong>, the scoreboard will be frozen and solutions for all the puzzles will be released, and we will prepare a wrap-up to be available soon after.

          <h4>How accessible is this hunt?</h4>
          <p>
            There may be puzzles involving colours, images and audio. If you encounter an accessibility issue, please email us at <a href="mailto:"></a> so that we can try to set up an accommodation. Some puzzles are not mobile-friendly.

          <h4>I think there’s a mistake in this puzzle!</h4>
          <p>Please describe the error in an email to <a href="mailto:epilogue@mitmh2024.com">epilogue@mitmh2024.com</a> and we’ll try to correct it.</p>

          <h4>I’m stuck on a puzzle. What should I do?</h4>
          <p>Here are some general puzzle tips that might be useful:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thoroughly check the work that you’ve already done. Fixing a small mistake or incorrect assumption can greatly help with getting unstuck.</li>
            <li>Get fresh eyes on the puzzle, or conversely, take a break and look at something else.</li>
            <li>Consider what information you haven’t used yet.</li>
            <li>It can be useful to put everything you have into your favourite search engine.</li>
            <li>Look at <a href="https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/index/keywords.html">similar examples</a> of the puzzle type you’re working on.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://beta.vero.site/try">Have you tried…</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Remember that after hints are released, you can also use them to get a nudge in the right direction. Please use them if you’re stuck!</p>
