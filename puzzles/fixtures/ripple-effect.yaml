    content: You will have to order the puzzles in order to progress to the next step
      after solving all of the associative wordplay.  Pay attention to the snarky
      commentary, parts of it will help at different solving steps (though you will
      likely have to solve enough wordplay around them in order to appreciate them).  Oh,
      and if it wasn't wholly intuitive - the TARGET WORD is the same across all the
      puzzles.

      you get considering what the TARGET WORD has to do with what is missing from
      each of the 18 puzzles, properly ordered.  If you aren't familiar, Google will
      most likely be your best friend here.  Once you get the idea, you will use it
      both to reorder the puzzles one last time and to apply the last two major unused
      features common to each of the 18 puzzles to extract your final message containing
      the puzzle's answer.
