    keywords: Start, Begin, Break in, Charms, Bracelets
    content: They say friendship bracelets tell a story. See if you can figure out
      what (fictional) story each set of charms is trying to tell. You are in Hollywood
      after all, so you can safely assume that these are likely film plots.

    description: Solver are not sure how to use the Walk of Fame stars or names.
    order: 1.0
    keywords: Start, Begin, Break in, Stars, Walk of Fame
    content: The Walk of Fame is a popular tourist destination in Hollywood. But what
      do the stars actually represent? Usually, they contain the name of a celebrity,
      and the symbol at the center of the star represents the industry in which they
      rose to fame. However the names in these stars do not look so conventional,
      so maybe you should ask the question, what does every great film need? And the
      answer of course, is a great villain! Pandora is known for her close ties to
      all things evil. See if you can pair each of these 'stars' with another of the
      puzzle artifacts that you have uncovered.

    order: 1.1
    keywords: Stars, Walk of Fame, Nametags
    content: Pandora is known for her close ties to all things evil. The text on each
      star clues a famous villain. The number represents the year the film the villain
      is from was released. You should be able to match each villain with a bracelet.

    keywords: Boxes, Addresses, Sender, Name
    content: Along with being provided bracelets and a map of Walk of Fame stars,
      you are also given the boxes each bracelet came in, as well a a return address
      for the person who sent them to Pandora. Now rather than listing the name of
      this person (which we can assume to be one of her "wicked" (evil) friends, a
      clue phrase is provided. Try interpreting this clue phrase as best you can in
      the context of the relationship between the villain and an aspect of each film.
      The address itself will provide an ordering.

    keywords: Extraction
    content: Pandora is not just a Greek Goddess, it is also a famous Jewellery retailer.
      Those of you with a keen eye should have spotted that some of the Bracelet charms
      are in fact "the real deal" (genuine Pandora charms you can find on their website).
      For your convenience, these have already been identified for you. You can also
      guess that this means the number of charms provides a enumeration, specifically,
      the enumeration of the thing referenced in the sender line in the address on
      each box.

    keywords: A NEW HOPE, second part of the puzzle, intermediate clue phrase
    content: So you thought you were done. You thought you had it all figured out.
      But you forgot one important aspect. This is Hollywood! And what does everyone
      successful film usually end up getting... that's right, a SEQUEL. The best sequels
      always stay true to the original. Think about how you could potentially reuse
      some of the obscure artifacts in this puzzle given a new context, or more specifically,
      a new film! But of course you need to also remember that with a new film also
      comes a new villain!

    content: In the first part of the puzzle, the number of charms on each bracelet

      on the Walk of Fame stars.

    content: By now, you will have discovered that this wasn't a two-part series,

      the boxes easy for Pandora. You may be wondering why the Hollywood Walk of Fame
      stars were even used at all, because the actors (celebrity) names haven't even
      been relevant to the puzzle. If you believe this to be true, take a closer look
      at that shipping manifest, specifically the column with all of the *****.

    content: By now, you will have discovered that this wasn't a two-part series,
      it was actually a trilogy! You are now looking to find out what made opening
      the boxes easy for Pandora. By now you should realize the actors names are important,
      however you may not be clear on the final extraction. We promise we tried to
      make it easier this time. As any celebrity will warn you, you should always
      read the fine print at the bottom of the document before signing any contracts.
      You already have a mass, and you are given an acceleration, so logically there
      is only one thing left to find... If you are still stuck, try using F=ma.
