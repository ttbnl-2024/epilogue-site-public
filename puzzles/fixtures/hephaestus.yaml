    guess: METAL CAN BONG
    response: "You ring Pluto with your suggestion. He is skeptical, to say the least. \"Uh, a <code>METAL CAN BONG</code>? Really? Surely you can come up with something more refined.\"\n\u0394 = 237.986"

      product and the raw material. The raw material still includes the weight of
      the impurities you had to remove.

    content: Since you are given the difference in the standard weight between the
      finished product and the raw material, you need to add the weight removed to
      the given weight to find the weight of the 2-3  elements that need to be alloyed
      in.

      the given added weight and insert those elements into the remaining letters
      to make a new word. Make sure to use the standard (abridged) weight.

    content: The length of the puzzle titles are each 1 letter longer than the resulting
      word after alloying in your 2-3 metals. Since Fe shows up in each title, if
      you consider it as a single element rather than two letters, it gives a location
      in each feeder answer.
