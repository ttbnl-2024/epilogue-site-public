    description: (They want a more explicit hint for beating Level Three.)
    order: 51.0
    keywords: level three, level 3
    content: Consider the comic you got from beating Level Two. If the observer swiveled
      their telescope left/right/up/down, then they change what part of the forest
      they can see. If they adjust the focus of their telescope, they can observe
      a larger/smaller part of the forest. Can you do the same?

    keywords: level four, level 4, final
    content: Your instance of the puzzle is independent from your teammates'. In fact,
      everything in the puzzle is local to your computer. Given that, how can you
      still emulate the rule taught by the comic you got from beating Level Three?
