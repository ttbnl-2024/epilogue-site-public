      removed words pair up
    order: 60.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: Try to pair up the doubled and removed words -- there should be 14 of
      each.  The doubled words need to be modified in a very appropriate way in order

    description: Solvers have the pairings of doubled and removed words but don't
      have the final clue phrase
    order: 80.0
    keywords: extraction, paired
    content: In each pair of a doubled word and removed word, one clue is Across and
      one is Down.  Overall, there are 14 pairs, equal to the number of rows and columns
      in the grid.  Use this to extract 14 squares from the grid, one for each pair,
      then read top-to-bottom.

    description: Solvers are stuck on the final clue phrase and don't know words need
      to be doubled
    order: 90.0
    keywords: final clue
    content: You have LOOK OVER EPISODES IN CRUST SEVEN; this matches with the blanks
      to form a cryptic clue, for which SEVEN is the enumeration (answer length).  This
      cryptic clue needs to be modified slightly, in a way reminiscent of what you
      did earlier in the puzzle.  Why do some of the words have two underlines?

      in the clue, but can't solve it
    order: 95.0
    keywords: final clue, doubled
    content: "After doubling the underlined words, you have the clue phrase \"LOOK\
      \ OVER OVER EPISODES IN IN CRUST CRUST (7)\", another cryptic clue.  Some hints:\r\
      \n-- The definition is \"LOOK OVER\".\r\n-- Episodes is often abbreviated \"\
      eps\".  But remember the other \"OVER\".\r\n-- One (but not both) of the INs\
      \ means \"put inside\".\r\n-- \"Crust\" can mean \"outer letters\"."
