      in fact too long or too short for the grid. Use the crossing answers to help
      determine how they get entered. You also might want to look up the mythological

    description: Solvers need a stronger nudge about the answers that don't fit into
      the grid.
    order: 2.1
    keywords: too long, too short, fit, procrustean
    content: In the myth of Procrustes -- whence the phrase "Procrustean Bed" comes
      -- the giant robber Procrustes would force travelers to lie on his stone bed.
      If they were too short, he would stretch them to the right length. If they were
      too tall, he would cut off the overhanging part to make them fit. You'll need
      to play the role of Procrustes and either "stretch" or "shorten" twelve of the
      answers (six across and six down) in a similar manner.

    order: 2.2
    keywords: too long, too short, fit, procrustean
    content: 'Six Down answers are one letter too short for their grid spaces: you
      will need to "stretch" them by doubling one of the letters to form a new word
      that fits the space. Similarly, six Across answers are one letter too long for
      their grid spaces. You will need to remove a letter from one end of the word
      (i.e., the first or last letter) to make a new word that fits the space. Once
      you are done, take a look at the doubled or removed letters in order. Do they
      spell any recognizable words?'
