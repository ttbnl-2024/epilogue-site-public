    content: One of the toys in this puzzle is a 5-disc Towers of Hanoi. How many
      different states can you put that toy in? The internet has more info about this
      particular graph.

    description: Help me find the blue state in some of the subpuzzles! (this hint
      covers the Snake, Blocks, and Chess subpuzzles)
    order: 50.0
    keywords: snake, blocks, chess
    content: "Snake: If the snake chases its own tail in a loop, then it will slither\
      \ around the same size loop in the graph. Can you ID the two loops the red state\
      \ lives in?\n\nBlocks: The blue state is in a long road of unique moves.\
      \ At the end of that road, the \u0393-shaped block is in the top-right corner,\
      \ and the \u231F block is in the bottom-right corner.\n\nChess: Try to find\
      \ a configuration where there's only 1 legal move. There are only 2 such configurations,\
      \ and you can use the red state to disambiguate which is which."

    description: Help me find the blue state in some of the subpuzzles! (this hint
      covers the Water Pouring, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Towers of Hanoi subpuzzles)
    order: 50.0
    keywords: water, tic, tac, toe, hanoi
    content: "Water pouring: The graph is a total mess. But it's symmetric, and the\
      \ symmetry maps the red state to the blue state. Can you find the symmetry of\
      \ the water-pouring toy? It's a generic symmetry of water-pouring puzzles: that\
      \ is, it applies no matter how tall each glass is.\n\nTic-tac-toe: What\
      \ move must have been played last, and what does the graph tell you about ways\
      \ O and X could have won earlier? A useful observation: numbering the columns\
      \ of the graph 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, there is a vertex in column 2 that leads to\
      \ two terminal vertices in column 3.\n\nTowers of Hanoi: The three corners\
      \ of this graph are the unique Towers of Hanoi states with only two legal moves.\
      \ What are those states? If all else fails, you can find info about this particular\
      \ graph online."
