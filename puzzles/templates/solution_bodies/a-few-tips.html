We see a series of illustrations depicting various people in difficult situations where they would need a specific tool to make their problem easier.
We start by figuring out exactly what tools are missing.
In the flavor text, phrases such as “looking up” and “leave you in the dark” evoke a night sky, and sure enough, research will tell us that these tools are all represented as official IAU (International Astronomical Union) designated constellations.
This is further confirmed by the phrase “instruments and utensils”.

Caption | Tool Clued | Constellation
--------|------------|--------------
Tip: You can figure out the angle between two distant things using a certain tool. It even works at sea! | Sextant | `SEXTANS`
Tip: If you have space in your living room, you can use a certain tool not only to tell the time, but also to make your living room look nice! | Pendulum Clock | `HOROLOGIUM`
Tip: If you're at sea and don't have the first tool, you can use another tool that has a smaller arc and is older in design, though it may not be as accurate![^1] | Octant | `OCTANS`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to see things that are too small to see without help! | Microscope | `MICROSCOPIUM`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to see things that are far away! | Telescope | `TELESCOPIUM`
Tip: You can figure out the weight of something by using a certain tool to compare it to the weight of something you already know the weight of! | Scales | `LIBRA`
Tip: If you ever get lost, you can use a certain tool that has a piece of metal in it that will point towards the top of the Earth!  | Mariner’s Compass | `PYXIS`
Tip: You can use a certain tool part as a pattern to help measure something you've set your sights on. At least two other tools mentioned earlier have this part in them![^2] | Reticle | `RETICULUM`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to shape different materials such as wood or stone! | Chisel | `CAELUM`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to make drawing circles by hand much easier! | Drafting Compass | `CIRCINUS`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to heat other things by filling the bottom of it with charcoal and lighting the charcoal on fire! | Furnace | `FORNAX`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to hold a painting up while you work on it, making it easier to draw or paint! | Easel | `PICTOR`
Tip: You can use a certain tool to push air into something else without having to use your own breath! | Air Pump | `ANTLIA`
Tip: People who build things out of wood can use a certain tool to measure 90 degree angles! | Carpenter’s Square | `NORMA`

This brings us to the actual images themselves.
The flavor text mentions “handy pointers” and sure enough, each image has a hand with an extended pointer index finger, and in one image there’s even a mouse pointer that resembles a hand with a pointer finger!
Various extra lines can also be found in each image, and the flavor text mentions needing to “chart out” your tools and to “line things up.”
This clues us that we need to overlay [the IAU’s official constellation charts](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/) over each image and line them up using the extra lines (with ).
This is further confirmed by the “h’s” at the the top of each image lining up with the hour marks on the actual charts.
Now we will see that each pointer finger is pointing at a single star in each constellation. In cases that are slightly ambiguous, we should take the star closest to each finger.

Once we have a list of stars, we need to figure out what to do with them.
Each star has a Bayer designation represented by a Greek letter ranging from Alpha to Epsilon, the first five letters of the Greek alphabet.
Using these letters as numbers from 1 to 5, we should index into the name of each constellation to get a new letter.

| Constellation  | Greek Letter | Index | Extract |
|----------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| `SEXTANS`      | Alpha        | 1     | `S`     |
| `HOROLOGIUM`   | Alpha        | 1     | `H`     |
| `OCTANS`       | Alpha        | 1     | `O`     |
| `MICROSCOPIUM` | Epsilon      | 5     | `O`     |
| `TELESCOPIUM`  | Alpha        | 1     | `T`     |
| `LIBRA`        | Epsilon      | 5     | `A`     |
| `PYXIS`        | Epsilon      | 5     | `S`     |
| `RETICULUM`    | Gamma        | 3     | `T`     |
| `CAELUM`       | Beta         | 2     | `A`     |
| `CIRCINUS`     | Gamma        | 3     | `R`     |
| `FORNAX`       | Alpha        | 1     | `F`     |
| `PICTOR`       | Beta         | 2     | `I`     |
| `ANTLIA`       | Delta        | 4     | `L`     |
| `NORMA`        | Delta        | 4     | `M`     |

This gives us the phrase `SHOOT A STAR FILM`.
Entering this as an answer we will then be prompted to film a short video describing how to use a tool based on a fictional constellation, such as those in the [Hole in the Ceiling of Hades](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/rounds/the-hole-in-the-ceiling-of-hades) round in MITMH 2024.
On completion, we receive our final answer: **`SONY PSP`**.

[^1]: The octant was invented around 1730 and has an arc of 45°, one eighth of a circle. This device was only useful during the daytime since it was too narrow to measure lunar distance. A few years later, the sextant was developed with a 60° angle so that lunar distance can be properly measured.
[^2]: This clue refers to the sextant and octant as a reticle or crosshair is usually built in, though sometimes telescopes or microscopes have a reticle as well. Both “reticle” and “Reticulum” come from a Latin word that means “little net”. This is referenced by a person holding a butterfly net in the illustration for this clue.
