  The given limericks, with white lettering on red, are paraphrases of real Burma-Shave advertising signs.
  We find the original Burma-Shave slogan, and as instructed by the last limerick, note the unique word common to both the limerick and the slogan.

  This is a cryptic clue, "Change up soap and so on without a sipper (4 5)".
  The wordplay is "change" indicating an anagrind of "up soap, so on", and
  "without a" to subtract <code>A</code>.
  The definition is "sipper".
  This resolves to the final answer <strong><code>SOUP SPOON</code></strong>.
