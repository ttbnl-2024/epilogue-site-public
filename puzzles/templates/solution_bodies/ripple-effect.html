The authors would like to recognize the first test solving team for their Herculean efforts in ensuring the clarity of the wording, tuning the clue cascades to all be solvable, calibrating the embedded solve path signposting for a good balance, and putting up with all referencing errors that inexorably sneak into a puzzle like this.  Thank you, Ciprian Tutu, Andrey Gorlin, Ethan Ordentlich, and Alina Khankin for your extraordinary work to make this puzzle better.

This puzzle is an homage to an annual contest (nominal participation fee after the first one, cash prize) that is coincidentally as old as MIT Mystery Hunt - it was first launched in 1981 by Alan Levine (aka Alien Navel in the National Puzzlers League) and continues to this day.  If you enjoy this kind of puzzle, the authors warmly encourage you to request PuzzleUp contest details at <a href="mailto:puzzleup@hotmail.com">puzzleup@hotmail.com</a>.  Let Alan know that we led you there!

As noted in the Author’s Preface, we wanted to create a true “team swarm” puzzle - something both seasoned and inexperienced solvers can chew on and contribute to both in parallel and individually.

The flavortext helps us resolve the basic puzzle mechanics and some of the least intuitive terminology as a highly-contextualized example (somewhat simplified from that used in the full contest):

- It should be easy enough to identify ATHENA has THEN inside of her, making contextual sense.
- It is easily and contextually inferrable directly (and indirectly, looking for words in reverse across the puzzle title) that “FEEL” is the only possible answer that fits WORD A, whose reversal “spans” across the space in “RIPP**LE EF**FECT”.  This is how “span” is used in the rest of the puzzle.
- The “unknown category” concept, given here with ???? - contextually, especially near the end of the sentence, it is easily inferred that ???? = TIME.
- “Transposal” is essentially used where one might typically use “anagram”.  This puzzle employs the NPL vernacular, where “anagram” has apt meaning.
- Clues cross-referencing to resolve ambiguity - it is easily inferrable that WORD B is a word like “GOOD” or “GREAT” and has to contain a “G” as noted later in the sentence.  “TEAR” for WORD C makes contextual sense, leaving “GREAT” for WORD B.  In turn, “TEAR” is further confirmed as a first-letter change from the singular of TIME A, which has to be YEARS
- “Word value” is easily Googled if not immediately inferred - the sum of A = 1, B = 2, etc. for the letters in a word).  Below are 2 online calculators you may have found useful when solving.  Having inferred TIME is the category, TIME B is either “seconds” or “minutes”, and only “minutes” has a word value = 101.

    - <https://www.dcode.fr/word-value>


These flavortext answers, along with other elements of the flavortext, should help us recognize retrospectively when they hit on one or both of the ahas as to where the puzzle is going.  The only other “terminology” we might need to infer is the use of parentheses, which imply a nested substitution into the sentence.

Turning our attention to the puzzles - reading through them, we can find several places where a TARGET WORD is defined and a lot of references to its word value.  It is quickly apparent it has something to do with music, and indeed, the word is MUSICIAN, which has a word value of 89.  The puzzles indicate there is an ordering to them, but they are presented blanked out, so we will have to determine their order.  Most if not all puzzles have direct pointers to other puzzles (either by # or by relative location to the current puzzle) to identify most of the order as more and more the associations are solved.  Every puzzle has two features - an unknown category (enumerated with question marks) that is often oddly specific and two NUMBERs specified at the end (A & B).  And of course, there are a lot of interconnected clues linking all kinds of disparate concepts, and a few indicators that there’s something important about, at least, some of them.

Billy Joel himself is clued, with an indication that he has an association (in addition to being a TARGET WORD) with the TARGET WORD’s word value of 89 - the first flash of inspiration is that each puzzle either/both lists outright or highlights a concept that is part of the Billy Joel song “We Didn’t Start the Fire”, which was released in 1989.  Several of the “weird commentary” clues should now make sense, e.g. Richard Nixon returning for a second time, but only if we solve the puzzle mentioning him (as associated with Watergate) in the puzzle directly after the one where he needs to be “back again”.  The puzzle is then to identify the song association for each of the other puzzles, which is enforced with the puzzle series order.  Each puzzle contains “n-1” references to a line from the song, and special attention must be paid to the missing references (as clued, “something’s missing”, a commonality for each of the puzzles).  NUMBER A applies as an index to them, and when read in puzzle (song lyric) order, they read: `UPDATE WITH UNKNOWNS`.

“UNKNOWNS” ostensibly refers to the unknown categories, but what does “UPDATE” mean?  The second flash of inspiration is to realize that there is an updated (2023) version of the song that extends, in its way, the decades into modern day, and that it is by a band that also features in the puzzle, Fall Out Boy.  Teams may already have identified some of the unknown categories were lacking “very obvious” answers - e.g. Director/Producer Surnames Featuring a European River, naming the pretty common Steven S(oder)bergh and the more obscure Stephen (Somme)rs - but where’s Steven Spi(elbe)rg?  We clue a “Hair Pair” but only provide one answer, not two?  The authors did include these - each of the unknown categories has another answer lurking throughout the lines of Fall Out Boy’s version of the song (e.g. Spielberg is in line 8).  Once these additional answers have been collected and ordered in order of the Fall-Out Boy song lyrics, NUMBER B can be applied as an extraction index, revealing the final message, `ANSWER IS SHENZHEN IO`, for the final answer of **`SHENZHEN IO`** - a video game that simulates the construction of electrical circuits from components and their operative code, much like the giant circuit of words and associations that we've put together from components here.

The table in the appendix summarizes the extractions, and the remainder of the appendix lists the answers to all 18 of the puzzles (approximately 820 in total).

{% block author-notes-md %}
The puzzle title was chosen both for how solving puzzle answers enables one to solve other puzzle answers, but as a nod to the song.  The flavortext, emphasizes what “We Didn’t” do, and your getting through it more quickly than we built it.  Perhaps, as Billy Joel might, you even sang your way through the decades as you solved this puzzle.  Perhaps you’re doing so now – it’s catchy, and you can tear through all those years in just a few minutes.
