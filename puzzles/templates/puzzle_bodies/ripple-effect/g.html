FORMER LEADER’s full name would rearrange to a string of CONSECUTIVE LETTERS of the alphabet if one instance of the only repeating letter in their name is Caesar-shifted -1. OCCUPATION A contains consecutively the COMPOSER. The full name of the (TARGET WORD), is comprised of the first name of (OCCUPATION A) A followed by the first name of (OCCUPATION A) B. EDIBLE A ends in (OCCUPATION A) B’s last name. Change the fourth letter of the COMPOSER and it would end with an answer from Puzzle #1. An anagram of ARTIST A’s last name is spanned consecutively across the FORMER LEADER’s COUNTRY A. Oh, and before you ask, COUNTRY A is not actually used in the next step of solving this puzzle series, but we’ll give you credit for considering it. The ARTIST A was played in a PLAY by an ACTOR answered earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. PLAY is the last word of the WORK. The first name of FORMER LEADER ends in an anagram of GAME SHOW. The reverse of the first word of the LANDMARK begins SINGER’s last name with that name's third letter changed. The second word of the LANDMARK begins SINGER’s first name. SINGER was played by ACTRESS in a TV movie; SINGER’s name contains all but the first of the CONSECUTIVE LETTERS. EDIBLE B begins EDIBLE A. Caesar-shift -1 the first letter of EDIBLE A and it would phonetically be a homophone of EDIBLE C. The movie version of MUSICAL (both of which starred ACTRESS) was directed by the alliterative DIRECTOR. Add a letter to DIRECTOR’s first name to make EDIBLE D. The MUSICAL serves as a descriptive synonym of the first word of WORK by ARTIST A. The second word of MOVIE A, produced by PRODUCER, has word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. PRODUCER’s first name is the last name of (OCCUPATION A) A and his last name is part of multiple answers throughout this puzzle series. The first and last words of TV SHOW A are the third and second words, respectively, of the WORK. TV SHOW B is spanned consecutively across (OCCUPATION A) B and is also found sequentially in EDIBLE C. MYTHOLOGICAL BEINGS A & B each can be considered a(n) OCCUPATION B (ten letter word). Change the last letter of MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A and it would end in a category from Puzzles #4 and #7, as well as the singular of one of the words in the UNKNOWN CATEGORY from Puzzle #3. MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A begins with BODY PART A. The second word of MYTHOLOGICAL BEING B is SYNONYM A. Change the last letter of the first word of MYTHOLOGICAL BEING B to an “A” and its three words would span consecutively an anagram of eight-letter WORD. SYNONYM B, the synonym of SYNONYM A, is a last name from Puzzle #6. Add an “A” to SYNONYM A and rearrange it along with SYNONYM B to create OCCUPATION C. The first word of TV SHOW C in which ACTRESS appeared, is the word ending OCCUPATION C. Add an “N” as the sixth letter in MYTHOLOGICAL BEING A and it will begin with the second word of MOVIE B. The first word of SONG begins OCCUPATION B, and the second word of SONG is an answer in Puzzle #8. The second word of MOVIE C is the first word of SONG. MOVIE C constitutes one-half of an album featured elsewhere in this puzzle series. COUNTRY B’s word value is the same as that of the TARGET WORD; Caesar-shift +1 the first letter of its second word and COUNTRY B would span consecutively a last name from Puzzle #6. Fill the space between the two words of COUNTRY B with a letter and it would end in the continent containing COUNTRY C. Add an “A” to SYNONYM C and it would rearrange to (former) COUNTRY C and the first word of COUNTRY B. A four-letter category from Puzzle #1 + WORD + a first name from this puzzle will collectively rearrange to the last names of FAMOUS FELLOW NATIONALS A & B + COUNTRY C (if you can figure out why we wrote this one to be so complicated, it might help you on the next step). FAMOUS FELLOW NATIONAL A is a TARGET WORD, and FAMOUS FELLOW NATIONAL B is ARTIST B. SYNONYM D, the second word of TV SHOW D, is the synonym of SYNONYM C and has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. TV SHOW D’s second word begins with the second word of the WORK. (OCCUPATION A) A’s last name is the first word of EDIBLE E. EDIBLE E’s last word begins with one of the SYNONYMS from Puzzle #17. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ?????? ? ??????? ???? ??? ???? ????; its initial letters’ word value equals that of the TARGET WORD. The first word (a verb) is the first word of at least one category in each of three different puzzles earlier than this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The third word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is the singular of a word used in another puzzle’s UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The rhyming last two words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY differ only by their first letter and collectively refer to a set of answers from Puzzle #15. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) is TV SHOW E, begun by alumnae of the reality show by TV PERSONALITY, who has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Change the third letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) to an “E” and it would contain consecutively the reverse of six-letter BODY PART B. Yea, we’re pretty sure we know what you’re wondering, and it should clear up as you perform the last step of solving this puzzle series. NUMBER A is the lowest non-zero number of episodes of the TV SHOWS in this puzzle in which ACTRESS appeared. NUMBER B is the number of answers sought for the unknown category in the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series.
