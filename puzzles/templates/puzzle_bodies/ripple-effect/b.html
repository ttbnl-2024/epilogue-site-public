PRODUCTS A & B were made by COMPANY A - as was one other we’re sure you’re expecting to see, but this was long enough already, so just write down the dance-associated one and enjoy the freebie. (OCCUPATION) B starred in TV SHOW A. BAND A (SYNONYM C) sang SONG A, which is heavily associated with both TV SHOW A and the aforementioned TV SHOW from Puzzle #15.

Change the first letter of the second-to-last word of SONG B and SONG B’s last two words would form ADJECTIVE, which has been used to describe the FAMOUS (EDIBLE A). The first and last words of TV SHOW B are PRODUCT A. Remove the fourth letter of the last name of CHARACTER C from TV SHOW B and it would begin with an anagram of WORD B. Six-letter EDIBLE C and seven-letter (slang) DRINK are both found sequentially in CHARACTER C’s last name. The last name of (TARGET WORD), a member of BAND C, ends in the same six letters as CHARACTER C’s last name.

(UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A has the same length, first letter, and punctuation placement as COMPANY A. Change the first letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B to a “D” and it would rearrange to COMPANY B. Add a letter to the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it would rearrange to (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. An anagram of the nine-letter first name of the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE is spanned consecutively across the third and fourth words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY; change the first letter of his last name and it would become a word seen in several answers throughout this puzzle series. An anagram of the two-word CAR MODEL is spanned consecutively across the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. Change the first letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C to create MATERIAL. Before issuing their PRODUCT C, COMPANY B would perform an ACTIVITY, the word value of which is the same as that of the TARGET WORD, and the first word of which, when preceding the last four letters of COMPANY B names PRODUCT C. The last word of PRODUCT C is the middle word of an UNKNOWN CATEGORY earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Caesar-shift +1 the fifth letter of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B and it would begin with a synonym of one of the words used throughout the puzzle text in this puzzle series (including this one). The species of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY B) is commonly associated with a (WORD A from Puzzle #15) (HOMOPHONE A from Puzzle #15).
