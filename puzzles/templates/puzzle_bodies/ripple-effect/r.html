The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ????????/???????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????. Two-word WEB SERIES associated with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. MOVIE A associated with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is an answer from Puzzle #2. The first word of MOVIE B (associated with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B) begins the second word of a NOVEL from Puzzle #3. The seven-letter PALINDROME is the subject of MOVIE B. The first names of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A & B are homophones of each other. Two-word MOVIE D is associated with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B; if you Caesar-shift -1 the first letter of MOVIE D’s second word, MOVIE D would begin with an anagram of a COMPOSER in an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Two-word MOVIE E is associated with (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A; the movie contains sequentially the middle name of an answer earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The fourth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY ends in the last name of PERSON, which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The ACADEMIC SUBJECT begins PERSON’s middle name and is a subject associated with PERSON. The sixth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY begins with BAND A, who sang SONG A. SINGER A’s first name is SONG A and her last name ends with MATERIAL, which is related to a category in Puzzle #1. SINGER A sang two-word SONG B, which is also SYNONYM A. SYNONYM B, the synonym of SYNONYM A, has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. SYNONYM C is a homophone of SONG A and the synonym of three-word SYNONYM D (MOVIE C, which starred an ACTOR from Puzzle #7). ADJECTIVE is composed of the first, first, and last words of one of the MOVIES + the atomic symbol of one of the ELEMENTAL STUFF from another puzzle. The last word of the fully-hyphenated ADJECTIVE is the third word of five-word SONG C and is also the first three letters of an answer from Puzzle #10. Change the last letter of the third word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it would rearrange to COUNTRY. CITY is in COUNTRY; its second half is the reverse of the first half of the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. SONG C (by BAND B) is something a good (MOVIE E second word) might declare. By contrast, SONG D (by BAND C) is something bad (plural of MOVIE E second word) might say, to which you would surely say SONG E. BAND B ends in the bigram that is reduplicated in BAND C. BAND C and the OCCUPATION, which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD, share the same reduplicated bigram. Add an "O" to SINGER B (whose name is nine letters total) and his name would rearrange to an answer from Puzzle #14 + an answer from Puzzle #15. SONG E's title is shared by one sung by SINGER B and one from MUSICAL. The MUSICAL's third word is the last word of SONG B and its first word begins an OCCUPATION from Puzzle #15. If you utter SONG E, an incredulous response might be SONG C, in which case you should respond that you weren't asking, but rather, you figured out a key feature each puzzle in this series has in common with the others, the resolution of which will direct you to the second part of solving this puzzle series. Add a letter to the end of the last name of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and the last name would contain the reverse of NUMBER A sequentially. At least two of the answers to the UNKNOWN CATEGORY from a puzzle nine positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series demonstrate the PHRASE. As you figure out the first step of solving this puzzle series, you’ll see the heavy-handed poetic license we exercised for a couple answers in this puzzle. The first word of PHRASE begins with the last name of the (TARGET WORD), who co-wrote a SONG in Puzzle #16. NUMBER B is represented by the title of the only song written and recorded by BAND B from Puzzle #10 that fits this category, excluding any song title that the band entitled with numerals.
