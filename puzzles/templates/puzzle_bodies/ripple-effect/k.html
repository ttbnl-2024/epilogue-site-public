SYNONYMS A-C are synonyms. SYNONYM B begins with a three-letter answer in Puzzle #6. Two-word SYNONYM C’s first word is an answer from the puzzle two positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series and its second word would fit one of the flavortext categories. SYNONYM D is a synonym of a different sense of SYNONYM A. IDIOM A’s word value is equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Its second word begins with SYNONYM J from Puzzle #1. IDIOM A is a synonym for three-letter IDIOM A SYNONYM, which is found consecutively within an answer from Puzzle #7. AMERICAN VIGILANTE A's last name is a homophone of the first word of IDIOM A once you add an “S” to the end of that word. His eight-letter first name begins with CITY that is associated with the first word of one of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY answers, but we’re sure you’re more used to calling him by his nickname. AMERICAN VIGILANTE B’s first name has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Remove the last letter of AMERICAN VIGILANTE B and it would be an irregular interleaving of UNITS OF MEASURE A & B (each four letters long). HEALTH CONDITION A is both a WORD A (five letters) and a WORD B (seven letters). Both WORDS A & B have word values equal to that of the TARGET WORD, and together relate to another health condition. FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAM A (EXCLAMATION A) is two-word SONG A by RAPPER A, whose first name has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The second word of FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAM A is SPORTS TERM B from Puzzle #2. The first two words (EXCLAMATION B) of five-word SONG B by RAPPER B are a synonym for SONG A, which is something we hope you do NOT do with this puzzle despite it likely being (IDIOM B). Five-word IDIOM B’s last word is SYNONYM A; its third word is EDIBLE A. If you replace the first letter of the five-letter second word of IDIOM B with another letter, its second and third words would combine to make EDIBLE B. The first word of three-word FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAM B is the first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. Both FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAMS serve needs for the same worthy population. Both the first name of RAPPER A and the last name of RAPPER B end in the same double letter. Remove the last letter of both RAPPERS; the first name of RAPPER B + the last name of RAPPER A would then comprise the CARTOON CHARACTER, and the last name of RAPPER B would then describe it. The six-letter CARTOON CHARACTER SYNONYM has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Three-word IDIOM C has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD; its first word is the past tense of SYNONYM A. WORD C has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD; its past tense is synonymous with IDIOM C. WORD C is the last word of SONG C by RAPPER B. Remove the last letter of the first word of SONG C and its first two words would be EXCLAMATION C. All three EXCLAMATIONS are synonymous. The second word of EXCLAMATION C are the two letters removed (in some order) from the RAPPERS earlier when crafting the CARTOON CHARACTER. The two-word HAIRCUT is sported by BAND MEMBER (quite different than when he was in BAND, and debuted in public attending a concert by a BAND earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series). The first word of HAIRCUT is associated with both the (WORD E) and (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. Change the third letter of BAND MEMBER’s first name to another and his full name would contain sequentially nine-letter WORD E. The (WORD E) contains consecutively the HEALTH CONDITION A. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ???? ?????; the word values of its initial letters sum to the word value of the TARGET WORD. The second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY ends the first word of one of the SONGS from Puzzle #13. The fourth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY begins one of the OBJECTS in a puzzle earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is the plural of the last half of a SYNONYM from Puzzle #1. Change the first letter of nine-letter (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and it would begin with the same five-letter word that begins RAPPER A. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A ends with something that can be associated with one of the categories in this puzzle. The first word of edible (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The third and fourth words of SONG D are the first two words of FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAM B, its seventh word is the inner letters of the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY, and its eighth word would fit its ninth word as a category (a category seen earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series). Thirteen-letter WORD D begins with the third word of FEDERAL CHARITY PROGRAM B and contains the first word of HEALTH CONDITION B. The second word of two-word HEALTH CONDITION B is comprised of SYNONYM D + the last word of EXCLAMATION A. Place an “I” between the first and last names of the FAMOUS GENERAL and it would span consecutively an anagram of the fourth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is found sequentially in the full name of the FAMOUS GENERAL. The FAMOUS GENERAL’s last name has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. EXPRESSION A’s third word is the second word of one of the answers to the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and its first word ends one of the categories in this puzzle. Three-word EXPRESSION B is synonymous with three-word EXPRESSION A; its first and third words are respectively the two words of EXCLAMATION C. NUMBER A can be found prominently on a bottle of the DRINK BRAND from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. There’s a two letter word that begins three answers in this puzzle, if it were read as an atomic symbol, its atomic number would be NUMBER B.
