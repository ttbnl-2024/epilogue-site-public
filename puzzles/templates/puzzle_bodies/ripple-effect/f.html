ELEMENTAL STUFF A has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. The inner letters of ELEMENTAL STUFF A are DRUG CLASS, the inner letters of which are the FOREIGN DIRECTOR’s last name, the inner letters of which are the chemical symbol for ELEMENTAL STUFF A. Remove the second letter of the last word of MOVIE A by the FOREIGN DIRECTOR and MOVIE A would become the SOMETHING WORN, the first half of which is the first half of a GAME featured in an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Switch two consecutive letters in BAND MEMBER A’s last name to make ELEMENTAL STUFF B. Change the first letter of the first name of BAND MEMBER A (from BAND A) and it would begin a fourteen-letter MEDICAL CONDITION. The MEDICAL CONDITION contains the reverse of WORD A, a four-letter answer in a puzzle four positions prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. An anagram of the mononymous MODEL/ACTOR spans consecutively BAND MEMBER B (also from BAND A). Caesar-shift +2 the first letter of the name of MODEL/ACTOR and it would be an anagram of the end of the MEDICAL CONDITION. ELEMENTAL STUFF D, synonymous with BAND B, has a fairly uncommon ELEMENTAL STUFF C (which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD). The last word of ELEMENTAL STUFF C is a last name from Puzzle #4. ELEMENTAL STUFF E’s first word rearranges to the last name of BAND MEMBER C from BAND D. The last name of ELEMENTAL STUFF F ends in BAND MEMBER D’s last name. BAND MEMBER D led BAND C. ELEMENTAL STUFF G begins with an anagram of the first name of ELEMENTAL STUFF F, and with an “S'' at the end, it would end with an anagram of the five-letter word beginning the TARGET WORD. Each word of BAND D is found sequentially in ELEMENTAL STUFF D. Add a letter to the first two parts of the name of BAND MEMBER C and they would rearrange to an answer from an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. Remove the two single-letter atomic symbols that end the fourth word of the (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B from OBJECT A and rearrange to make OBJECT B (the latter of which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD). The first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A also ends in those same two atomic symbols. Remove a letter from OBJECT B and it would rearrange to ELEMENTAL STUFF H, whose chemical symbol would be the same as that of another ELEMENTAL STUFF if that symbol’s second letter were Caesar-shifted -1. The singular of OBJECT A is synonymous with OBJECT B. Remove the fourth letter of ELEMENTAL STUFF I to make the FLOWER. Change the seventh letter of ELEMENTAL STUFF I to an “E” and it would begin with the first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. The first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY ends with the first half of one of the BANDS. BAND E was led by the (TARGET WORD); add a letter and BAND E would rearrange to the plural of a category found elsewhere in this puzzle series (the plural has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD). The (TARGET WORD)’s first initial and second part of her last name together comprise a COMPOSER from the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The (TARGET WORD) featured on a song – an answer elsewhere in this puzzle series – that was covered by BAND D. Add a letter from BAND B to the first two parts of the name of BAND MEMBER C and it would rearrange to WORD B, which chemically describes the product represented by the FOOD BRANDS in Puzzle #6. The first word of SONG A by BAND D is the second half of BAND E. The first word of SONG B by BAND B is ELEMENTAL STUFF J, which can be found sequentially in BAND MEMBER C’s full name. One of the two nationalities of SINGER is that of a country to find in Puzzle #12. Change the spacing of SINGER to create DRINK, which is associated with the DRINK from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. SONG C by SINGER shares the same last three words as BAND C. TITLE is an anagram of the first two words of BAND C and contains sequentially the reverse of the second word of the DRINK. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ??????? ?????? ???????. One of the words of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is the plural of a word in the flavortext. Only the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY can be broken down purely into atomic symbols. Add a “W'' to the end of three-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and its last two words are an anagram to an answer from Puzzle #17. Four-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B is directly associated with an answer from Puzzle #1; its last two words have a combined word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. Change one letter in the last name of ELEMENTAL STUFF F and it would become the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B. Five-letter MOVIE B begins the last word of one of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY answers. EDIBLE A, the singular of which has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD, is an anagram of OBJECT B and an atomic symbol for the first word of one of the SONGS. EDIBLE B is the first name of BAND MEMBER B; EDIBLE B flavored like EDIBLE A would probably be (ALBUM from Puzzle #1). BAND MEMBER B’s last name is the FORMER COUNTRY. The SLANG TERM, generally local to (first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A), is an anagram of the second word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. NUMBER A is found sequentially in the EDIBLE A and the reverse of NUMBER B is found sequentially in the EDIBLE A.
