Alliterative (TARGET WORD)s A & B worked together on (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A, which is on ALBUM A. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ??? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???????. Change the third letter of the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and its reverse would be found sequentially in the first name of CHARACTER from TV SHOW A. Change the last letter of the first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and the first three words will span consecutively a last name of an answer from Puzzle #9. Change that letter again and the first three words will span consecutively the last name of an answer from Puzzle #4. Remove the second letter from the fourth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and its inside letters would rearrange to LETTERS A & B, the first two words, respectively, of the SOCIETY. The last word of SONG A on ALBUM A is the second word of SONG B. The second word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A is the last word of SONG B. The ICE CREAM FLAVOR is the first word of SONG B followed by a word found sequentially in the last name of (TARGET WORD) B. CITY A (in STATE A), which has the same word value as the TARGET WORD, is where (TARGET WORD) B died. CITY B (in STATE B) is the last name of (TARGET WORD) C, and his SONG B is about STATE B. Remove a letter from the last name of (TARGET WORD) B and it would become the last word of SONG C by (TARGET WORD) C. The last name of FOOTBALL PLAYER, who played for one of the CITIES, begins and ends with the abbreviations of the two STATES, in some order. His first name is the same as that of an ATHLETE from an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. BASEBALL PLAYER’s first name begins with the third word of ALBUM B by (TARGET WORD) A. The NOVEL (also BASEBALL PLAYER’s NICKNAME) was the inspiration for the name of ALBUM B. Add a letter to the front of (TARGET WORD) A’s first name and it would make BAND A. The first name of the MUPPET is a homophone of BAND A, the lead singer of which is WRESTLER. SONG D, the name of ALBUM C by BAND A, is the first word of BAND B. BAND B was amusingly mis-associated with the music GENRE in Puzzle #5 in TV SHOW B, but they are the same genre as both (TARGET WORD) A & B as well as BAND A (you should find this helpful along the next step of solving this puzzle series). Change the first letter of the second word of ALBUM D by BAND B and it would become CHURCH-ASSOCIATED THING A. CHURCH-ASSOCIATED THING B is the last word of BAND B. The reverse of ALBUM D would have been a good answer to the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B, who would fit a category from the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series, is composed of two equal-length words. If you Caesar-shift -1 the last letter of its second word it would become SONG E from ALBUM B. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C is a word associated with a category from Puzzle #1 that is the last name of an answer in Puzzle #18. OCCUPATION ends (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. SONG F was featured in TV SHOW A (a word that can come after the first word of an answer in Puzzle #7 to make something related to the DRINK BRAND). The DRINK BRAND has the same word value as the TARGET WORD. The first word of the DRINK BRAND is the second word of SONG G by a TARGET WORD referenced earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The first word of SONG G is an answer from Puzzle #10, and SONG G has the same word value as the TARGET WORD. MOVIE contains the plurals of MODES OF TRANSPORTATION A-C. PHRASE, which is comprised of MODE OF TRANSPORTATION A + the nickname of CHARACTER B from Puzzle #5, is the way both (TARGET WORD)s B & C died. The two words of SONG H from ALBUM B are the same length; its first word is the first word of an answer from Puzzle #5 and its last word is MODE OF TRANSPORTATION B. ANIMAL B (the singular of one of FOOTBALL PLAYER’s teams) and ANIMAL C (first word of SONG I) are related to ANIMAL A (second word of an answer from Puzzle #5). Change the second letter of ANIMAL D (plural) and it would end with the second word of DRINK BRAND. Rearrange ANIMAL D to make the last word of SONG F. (MODE OF TRANSPORTATION C) MODEL is composed of the first word of an answer from Puzzle #9 and the first word of SONG I. Two-syllable (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) D begins with the ending of LETTER A and ends with the first word of the DRINK BRAND. PHYSICIST’s last name is both the first and last word of SONG J; her first name is the last word of SONG I and her last name ends a last name from Puzzle #10. PHYSICIST’s last name is also the name of a MOVIE directed and starred in by an ACTRESS from Puzzle #2. NUMBER A is the retired uniform number of an answer in this puzzle. NUMBER B is the puzzle # of this puzzle when ordered properly in the puzzle series.
