The last names of ACTOR A (who played CHARACTER A) & ACTOR B (who played CHARACTER D) are CITY A and CITY B, respectively. CHARACTERS A-D are from the TV SHOW. CHARACTER B, who was ___ ___ ___ ___ (respectively, the seventh, fifth, sixth, and fourth words of PROVERB). Hm, you’ll have to pick the one whose portrayer is alliterative. Uh, the one whose last name begins with something you can find on an industrial vehicle? Oh wait, I got it - add an “A” into CHARACTER B and it would contain consecutively the MOUNTAIN. You should still write that PORTRAYER down, though, he might come in handy later. AUTHOR A shares the first name of CHARACTER A (SPORTS TERM A) and the last name of ACTOR A. CHARACTER C rearranges into WORD and the three-letter MYTHOLOGICAL BEING, who is described by the second word of PHRASE B from Puzzle #15. The ATHLETE’s first name is an anagram of the MYTHOLOGICAL BEING with a single letter change. Change the third letter of the ATHLETE’s last name to a “V” and his name would span consecutively the reverse of a five-letter word that could precede a category from Puzzle #4. ATHLETE played for the same team as an athlete from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. ATHLETE’s sport is the same as all of the SPORTS TERMS. The fifth and last words of NOVEL A by AUTHOR B are CITY B and CITY A, respectively. NOVEL B and the SHORT STORY COLLECTION were authored by AUTHOR A. The second word of NOVEL B would make a suitable answer to one of the categories in the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series, and the end of that word is an answer to that category in that puzzle. The SHORT STORY COLLECTION’s first word is the first word of the PROVERB and its last word is the last name of POET A (whose first and last names have the same word value). The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ???-???? ????-???? ?????????? ????????. The sum of the word values of the initial letters of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is equal to that of the TARGET WORD. ACTRESS was in MOVIE, whose first word is the singular of the last word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and whose last word can be categorized under a multi-answer category from Puzzle #4. One hyphenated term of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY has a collective word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD and contains three different pairs of consecutive letters in the alphabet. The other hyphenated term contains consecutively a repeated bigram. Change the first letter of the fifth word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY and it would rearrange to the first two words of the ACADEMIC PROGRAM at a school featured in one of the answers to the puzzle four positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The acronym for the ACADEMIC PROGRAM begins at least one of the categories in this puzzle. Add a letter to the last name of the ATHLETE and his last name would rearrange to a last name from a puzzle earlier in the properly-ordered puzzle series + (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. SPORTS TERMS B and C are the first and third word of NOVEL A respectively and have the same word value. SPORTS TERM D has the same word value as the TARGET WORD and describes the ATHLETE. Remove the first letter of the second word of two-word (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B and it would rearrange to ACTRESS. The first two names of POET B are ACTRESS, and her last name begins with one of the first names in this puzzle. POEM, by POET A, describes an area directly impacted by (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. SONG begins with NOVEL B, and was sung by BAND, something else directly impacted by (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. NUMBERS A and B are both the only applicable answer from a puzzle adjacent to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series that is not also an answer in the NUMBER category within that puzzle.
