The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ???????? ?? ?????? ?????. Add an “A” to its first word and it would rearrange to an answer from Puzzle #15 and a KING whose people had worshiped her in another personification. Its last word is a homophone for the first name of ACTRESS. The third word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY is a category from the puzzle directly prior to this in the properly-ordered puzzle series. ACTRESS played CHARACTER A, whose first name has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD and whose last name begins with an answer to an UNKNOWN CATEGORY from an earlier puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The first word and initial part of the second word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A, together, are CHARACTER B, from PLAY. The first word of the PLAY would be found sequentially across the name of one of the CHARACTERS from the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series if the last letter of her first name were changed to an “E”. Its last word, SYNONYM C, is a synonym of SYNONYM D, one of the answers to the flavortext. DRINK BRAND A is spanned consecutively across the UNKNOWN CATEGORY’s first three words. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B, associated with GAME, begins with a five-letter answer elsewhere in this puzzle series. The first half of GAME is antonymous with the second half of GAME. Change the first letter of the last name of FORMER LEADER A and it would begin with an anagram of the first word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. The reverse of DRINK BRAND B is SYNONYM A. SYNONYM B is the synonym of SYNONYM A, the last name of AUTHOR and the last word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) C. Both DRINK BRANDS can be categorized by one-word MOVIE A. MOVIE B stars an ACTRESS from Puzzle #15; its last word is the second word of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. MOVIE B’s second word and third word are DANCES A and B, respectively. ACTOR starred in MOVIES A & B; his last name would rearrange to the third word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY with one vowel changed to another. ACTOR’s last name ends an answer to Puzzle #3. The nine-letter MATERIAL comes from SYNONYM B; the five-letter word beginning it is found consecutively in the first word of the UNKNOWN CATEGORY. (TARGET WORD) is from COUNTRY B. Change the fifth letter of his last name and it would begin with CITY in COUNTRY B. COUNTRY B contains consecutively a three-letter SYNONYM from Puzzle #17. The first word of three-word SONG A by (TARGET WORD) is SONG D from Puzzle #1; collectively the three words mean its opposite. Four-word SONG B by (TARGET WORD)’s last word is an antonym of a five-letter answer from the puzzle directly prior to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. SONG C’s last word is DANCE A, and is from a musical that is an answer elsewhere in this puzzle series (but not clued as such). The FOOD BRAND contains sequentially the last name of FORMER LEADER A. The first name of FORMER LEADER A begins with the nickname of AUTHOR. Remove an “M” from FORMER LEADER B and rearrange to make FORMER LEADER C, who served under another leader featured elsewhere in this puzzle series. FORMER LEADERS A and B led the same COUNTRY A. The BIBLICAL CHARACTER might be defined by the reverse of the COUNTRY A; remove his third letter and he would become WORD, which begins and ends various answers throughout this puzzle series. BAND A’s second word ends the reverse of COUNTRY A and is from a state that is part of an answer to Puzzle #12. (TARGET WORD) was once a member of BAND B. One might find a (first two words of SONG C) in (homophone of BAND B). Change the third letter of BAND B and it would contain sequentially SOVIET SPACE LAUNCH A. Add a letter to the last name of ACTOR and it would rearrange to SOVIET SPACE LAUNCH B. SOVIET SPACE LAUNCH C’s inner letters rearrange to the last name of the CURRENT LEADER (if you’re desperate to designate which one, you should pick only between the first two). ACTOR appeared in MOVIE C, which is a first-letter change for one of the answers in this puzzle, and which was directed by an answer to the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. NUMBER A is the Building # of a building at a school featured in a puzzle adjacent to this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series whose name is a homophone of the last name of an ACTOR from Puzzle #15. Add a letter to a category from Puzzle #1 to create NUMBER B.
