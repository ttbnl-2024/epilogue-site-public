The MUSICAL/MOVIE A contains two consecutive palindromes. The ACTRESS starred in the MUSICAL/MOVIE A as CHARACTER A, the anagram of which ends the MUSICAL/MOVIE A. The SHAKESPEARE PLAY is an anagram of the first name of ACTRESS and begins with EDIBLE A. The anagram of the five-letter TREE is spanned consecutively across ACTRESS. CHARACTER B is also from MUSICAL/MOVIE A, played in MOVIE A (but not the MUSICAL) by an actress whose last name would be a fitting answer for one of the flavortext categories. EDIBLE B ends with the beginning of one of the categories in this puzzle and has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. CHARACTER C was portrayed by an ACTRESS in a TV SHOW that are both answers to a puzzle ten positions after this one in the properly-ordered puzzle series. CHARACTER B and the BASEBALL PLAYER share a WORD (the plural of WORD has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD), designated here as (WORD) A. The ALBUM, featuring SONG A (EDIBLE B) by SINGER, is a homophone of (WORD) B, the WORD of CHARACTER C. SINGER’s name is found sequentially across CHARACTER B and its anagram would begin SONG A if the song’s first and last letters were switched. If the fourth letter of the middle name of BASEBALL PLAYER were Caesar-shifted +1, it would begin the first word of SONG B from MUSICAL/MOVIE A. Change the first letter of ACTRESS’s last name to create SYNONYM B, the synonym of the ALBUM (SYNONYM A). SONG C from MUSICAL (but not MOVIE A) is the inner letters of SYNONYM C. SYNONYM D, the synonym of SYNONYM C, is a first-letter change of SYNONYM B. SONG B and SONG D are sung by the same singer whose WORD is (WORD) C. SONG D + EDIBLE A rearrange to the first/middle initials + last name of FOUNDER A, who died in one of the CITIES answered in Puzzle #2. Exchange the last word of (WORD) C with a homophone and it will become TITLE A – the first name of the person currently holding TITLE A begins the last name of an answer in this puzzle. The last word of SONG B (SYNONYM E) is MOVIE B that starred an ACTOR referenced several times in this puzzle series. SYNONYM F, the synonym of SYNONYM E, has a word value equal to that of TARGET WORD. SYNONYM G is the first half of SYNONYM F. SYNONYM H, the synonym of SYNONYM G, would span consecutively across SONG B if the second to last letter of the first word of SONG B were changed to an “A”. SYNONYMS J and K are synonyms of SYNONYM I and collectively have a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. SYNONYM J begins the second word of an answer in Puzzle #17. Remove an “N” from SYNONYM I and it would rearrange to the POLITICAL REGION, founded by FOUNDER B, whose surname is a last-letter change of one of the CHARACTERS. Change the last letter of the last word of the POLITICAL REGION and the POLITICAL REGION would rearrange to the first word of an answer from the next puzzle in the properly-ordered puzzle series. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY is enumerated ???????????? ????? ???????. The UNKNOWN CATEGORY’s first word begins with the singular of a MUSICAL found elsewhere in this puzzle series and its second word is an answer elsewhere in this puzzle series. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A spans consecutively the last name of the alliterative ACTOR. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B’s last name has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD and its etymology is the same as the first name of (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A. (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) B’s last name begins his middle name, and his first name is TITLE B. (WORD) D relates to (UNKNOWN CATEGORY) A and has a word value equal to that of the TARGET WORD. (WORD) E relates to the BASEBALL PLAYER and its second word is TITLE B. NUMBER A is the word value of the middle initial of FOUNDER A. NUMBER B is the last word of a multi-word answer from Puzzle #4.
